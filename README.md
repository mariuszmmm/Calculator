# **Calculator**

A simple calculator allowing to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root, and percentages.  
It has an on/off switch, a function to clear the last entered digit, and a toggle for changing the sign (+/-).  
(In the developer console, you can observe the current states of the variables used.)
